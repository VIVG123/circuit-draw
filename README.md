## Requirements
*pyopenGl* - ` $ pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate `

## Instructions:
- **AND Gate**:
	- Press `a` and left click anywhere on the grid to show an AND gate.
	- Click the right or middle button of mouse to remove the AND gate.

- **NOT Gate**:
	- Press `n` and left click anywhere on the grid to show an NOT gate.
	- Click the right or middle button of mouse to remove the NOT gate.

- **Horizontal Wire**:
	- Press `h` and left click anywhere on the grid to show an Horizontal Wire.
	- Click the right or middle button of mouse to remove the Horizontal Wire.


- **Vertical Wire**:
	- Press `v` and left click anywhere on the grid to show a downward Vertical Wire.
	- Click the right or middle button of mouse to remove the downward Vertical Wire.
	- Press `V` and left click anywhere on the grid to show a upward Vertical Wire.
	- Click the right or middle button of mouse to remove the upward Vertical Wire.
	 
- **Switching a wire on/off**:
	- Press `g` and left click anywhere on the grid to send digital 1 through the wire.
	- Press `r` and left click anywhere on the grid to send digital 0 through the wire.
